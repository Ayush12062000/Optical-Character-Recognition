# Optidash_Project_OCR

## What is an OCR ? 
Optical character recognition or optical character reader is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.

To train our network to recognize these sets of characters, we utilized the MNIST digits dataset as well as the NIST Special Database 19 (for the A-Z characters).
